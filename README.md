Here are some tools for using Fantasy Grounds (with a bias for Linux).
The sound scripts have variables at the top that you will need to 
set to suit your setup.

* fg-sound-setup.sh This script sets up the extra virtual channels for
  playing sound-effects, ambient sound and regular microphone chat
  with separate controls for each (adjustable from your Audio mixer).
* fg-sound-teardown.sh Removes the special audio plumbing so your
  computer can return to normal.
* fg-fx-player.sh This script will use mplayer to play short sound effects
  selected from a directory. The sound effects are intended to be
  triggered by the AudioOverseer extension.
* fg-music-player.sh This script is intended to play ambient sound or
  background music using the vlc music player.
